Welcome to the start of our journey

in this part one of the course.

So this part is all about learning the React fundamentals.

And so you'll acquire foundational skills

such as setting up new React apps,

React components, props, JSX,

how to handle events, and the fundamentals of state

and state management in order to make your apps dynamic.

Part one also includes tons of small

but beautiful projects, exercises, and challenges,

so that you can hit the ground running

with the super important fundamentals

and start writing a lot of code right away.

So without further ado,

let's dive right into the world of React.
